Agenda  
Item 4.  Report by the State Superintendent of Education  
 
State Superintendent of Education John White stated that the final 
statewide tour to discuss career education e fforts and career diploma 
implementation will begin next week.  Past tours have provided two 
specific lessons:  (1) the stigma that is often attached to career education 
must be removed, and (2) if real economic opportunity is to be offered to 
students who  are not immediately going to a four -year university, we must 
ensure that the career education that is provided results in credentials 
that allow them to continue their education and to succeed in the 
workplace.  Specific components of Jump Start will be p roposed for public 
discussion, including 8th graders making the transition to high school; 9th 
and 10th grade curriculum, 11th and 12th grade curriculum, credentials that 
students can achieve in that time,  rewards that school systems will accrue 
when stude nts succeed in career education, and how a system of 
technical preparation can be funded so that students can be employed in 
Louisiana jobs.

educational options for students in low -performing schools, and  
2. providing for the training or planning period for high- potential school 
leaders who intend to lead a school focused on serving this student

Charter School Program and Race to the Top grants and from 8 (g) New 
Schools Incubation.   Recipients of funds submitted competitive Believe 
and Succeed grant proposals to the LDE and were evaluated using a

5.2.9 Management and Finance  - Competitive  
 
On motion of Mr. Gu illot, seconded by Ms. Boffy, the Board approved  the 
following allocation:  
 
Allocation:  Early Childhood Programs: Louisiana Early 
Education Program (LEEP)  
Amount:  $110,000 
Funding Period:  01/01/ 2014 - 9/30/2014 
Source of Funds:  Federal  
 
Purpose:  This is year two of a three year grant. The purpose of the 
Preschool  LEEP (Louisiana Early Education Program) S ummer  Institute  is 
to provide certification and training opportunities for early intervention 
specialists and/or teachers seeking certification in early intervention   The 
Early Intervention (EI) certification is required for Louisiana teachers who 
provide services to children with developmental delays from birth through 
kindergarten.  These EI specialists work very closely with regular 
education preschool  teachers as well as the families to ensure the 
children with disabilities are provided a free appropriate public education, 
affording them the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential, and that 
this education will be provided by qualified individ uals. A review of current 
data indicates a shortage of certified teachers in the field of e arly 
intervention/early childhood special education.  Currently reported for this 
school year, there are approximately 574 Early Intervention (EI) teachers 
across th e state and, of that number, there are 168 (29.3%) who are not 
certified in the field.  There is a great need for teachers with certification to 
teach children with developmental delays from birth through k indergarten 
especially in our more rural areas. By  providing funds to two university 
applicants, more teachers can acquire the courses required to be Early 
Intervention certified.
